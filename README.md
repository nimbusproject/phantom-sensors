Phantom Sensors
===============

This is a repository of common collectors (sensors) that are intended

It follows the conventions defined for the [tcollector collectors directory](https://github.com/OpenTSDB/tcollector).

Configuration for your collectors can be put into etc, common library code in lib,
and all collectors can be placed into the 0 directory.
